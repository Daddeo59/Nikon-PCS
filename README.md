# Nikon-PCS
Repository of downloadable Picture Control System NP3 files for Nikon Z series cameras.  
In Development, discussion always welcome.
These are the fruits of my hobby. 
## Introduction
Almost 20 years ago I began an endless search for "film simulations". About 2010, I purchased various software promising this look or that look. I compared the outcomes side by side by side. My conclusion was that not one was very accurate, and the plethora of "custom presets" just made the problem worse because no one was applying any actual film characteristic physics. The best company then, and now, is DxO. It's film simulations are accurate. I use their software a lot. However, sometimes you just want to "load some film" in your digital camera and just shoot that day. That is where, for Nikon users, this type of system becomes handy.  
Usually, I want to shoot black and white. The Nikon MC PCS does a good job, but there are a few tweaks that I feel make the images better to my eye. You might agree, or not, but you too should try to understand tone curves and filters and use these to begin your own journey of exploration and learning. 
## Henri 2310 MC
This is based on Deep Tonal MC Nikon PCS but adjusted with contrast, clarity and sharpmess to my personal taste. It gives a very rich toanal range with the addition of an Orange/Red filter for enhanced sky contrast. It is subtle and refined.
